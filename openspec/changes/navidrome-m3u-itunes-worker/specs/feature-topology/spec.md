## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Leaf services SHALL own secret and runtime contracts
Leaf service modules SHALL own semantic secret registration, template assembly, runtime wiring, assertions, and restart semantics, and SHALL accept explicit contract inputs such as `secretFiles.*` and `secretKeys.*` instead of requiring callers to mutate raw internal `sops.secrets` definitions.

#### Scenario: Application supplies secrets to a leaf
- **WHEN** an application composes a leaf service that needs secrets
- **THEN** it provides explicit contract inputs to the leaf
- **AND** the leaf remains responsible for the actual `sops.secrets` / `sops.templates` registration and runtime consumption

#### Scenario: Host overrides a secret source
- **WHEN** a host needs to bind a host-specific secret source for an enabled feature
- **THEN** it does so through the exposed contract surface
- **AND** the host does not need to know or mutate the leaf’s internal secret registration names

#### Scenario: Traktor leaf is removed
- **WHEN** home-forge evaluates the Navidrome playlist-sync worker
- **THEN** it imports the upstream worker module and configures only its M3U import / engine export option surface
- **AND** no repository-owned Traktor leaf, NML option, or Traktor collection state is restored
